## VOCs List Package

_ ⚠️ This package is currently in development. It is not yet ready for production use. ⚠️ _

This npm package provides a database of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly found in industrial, commercial, and residential settings. It allows you to retrieve information about specific VOCs, as well as to search for VOCs by name or chemical formula.

The package includes a `getVOCsList` function that returns a list of all VOCs in the database. Each VOC is represented as a VOC object, containing its name, chemical formula, molecular weight, boiling point, melting point, vapor pressure, and other relevant data.

In addition, the package includes a `searchVOCsList` function that allows you to search for VOCs by name or chemical formula. This function returns an array of VOC objects that match the search criteria.

This package is useful for anyone working with VOCs data, such as environmental consultants, laboratory technicians, and industrial hygienists. It provides a convenient way to access information about specific VOCs, as well as to search for VOCs by name or chemical formula, facilitating research and analysis of VOCs in various contexts.
