# EHS Utils Package

This is a collection of packages related to Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) data.

## Packages

- [Regulatory Authorities](./packages/regulatory-authorities/README.md)
- [VOC List](./packages/voc-list/README.md)

## Road Map

We are currently working on:

- Expanding the list of regulatory agencies to cover all 50 US states
- Adding more data to the VOC List package

## Additional Packages

Here are some additional packages we could consider adding in the future:

1. OSHA Compliance - This package would provide information on OSHA compliance for a given state and industry.
2. Chemical Hazard Information - This package would provide information on the hazards associated with a given chemical and their limits.
3. Environmental Regulations - This package would provide information on environmental regulations for a given state and industry.
4. [Your Idea Here!](https://github.com/SRP-Environmental/ehs-utils/discussions) - We are open to suggestions for additional packages. Please open a discussion if you have an idea for a package.
